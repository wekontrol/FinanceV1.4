Convert the entire project to a clean and fully functional internationalization (i18n) architecture.

Ensure that when the user selects a language on the login screen, the whole system loads in that language after login and keeps that preference stored.

Guarantee that every text in the UI is translated using keys, without any hard-coded strings.

Fix broken or missing translations so that no raw keys like “dashboard.behavioral_analysis” appear on the interface.

Allow “translator” users to edit language files safely, without breaking the system.

Maintain functional compatibility with Linux Ubuntu, where the app will run server-side.

Follow these steps and rules carefully:

1. Restructure the i18n system

Create a clean folder structure like:

/locales
    /pt
        translation.json
    /en
        translation.json
    /es
        translation.json
    /fr
        translation.json
    /it
        translation.json
    ...


Each translation file must contain the same keys across all languages.

Remove any text hard-coded in Vue/React/HTML/JS files and replace them with i18n keys.

Standardize all keys in this format:

dashboard.behavioral_analysis
dashboard.total_expenses
navbar.settings
auth.login
auth.password
errors.invalid_credentials


Fix every broken key reference.

2. Correct the language selection behavior

When the user selects a language on the login screen, store it in:

localStorage

session

or user profile database field (choose best practice based on current architecture)

After login, load the chosen language BEFORE rendering the main layout.

Ensure that navigation between pages never resets the active language.

3. Implement update system for translators

Create a protected route/page where users with the “translator” role can:

View all existing keys

Edit translations

Insert missing translations

Save into JSON files or database (choose safest method)

Add validation so translators cannot delete keys, only update text values.

4. Clean and reorganize the codebase

Remove unused files.

Remove duplicated translation keys.

Replace any Portuguese-only UI text with i18n keys.

Verify that backend messages also use i18n where appropriate.

Ensure all components call the translation library correctly.

5. Maintain server-side operation

All changes must remain compatible with deployment on Linux Ubuntu.

Confirm that dependencies, build scripts, and start scripts remain functional.

Prepare new commit structure for GitHub.

6. Final verification

After restructuring:

Test switching languages across all pages.

Confirm that no untranslated text or raw key appears.

Confirm that the translator panel works without breaking JSON structure.

Ensure consistency across all languages.
